# Unit 2 Project Readme

### Description of my app:

##### Title: YUP! (Your Unique Planner!)

##### My app will be designed to allow users to create their own personalized planner. 

* Will require authentication upon logging in so that each user can create their own.
* Once they're logged in, they'll have the option to "Create new planner".
* Once they've created a new planner, they'll see an automated layout with the days of the week. This is where they'll begin to use CRUD functions such as create a new event, update dates, previous events, and notes. They'll also be able to delete notes and/or days of the week such as as Satuday and Sunday as most people don't use planners for those days.

* Users will also have the option to add multiple planners.

* I want to give the user options to select different layouts. However, I'm not yet sure of how I'll be able to accomplish this but it is my personal extra credit goal :)
